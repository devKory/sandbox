# nodejs-scripts

Various Node.js scripts that I'm experimenting with.

## Scripts (npm run)

- **build**: cleans dist folder and transpiles all TypeScript files in the project
- **dev**: cleans dist folder, transpiles all TypeScript files, and then watches for changes
- **prod**: cleans dist folder, transpiles all TypeScript files, and removes the tests folder from dist
- **test**: cleans dist folder, transpiles all TypeScript files, and runs the JestJS testing framework
